# Instructions for Mid-Term #1

* The exam will be distributed via a GitHub Classroom link which we will email to you. (Of course, you would not be reading this if you had not already received that email and clicked the link.) Once you click on the link, a private repo will be created under the GOV-1005-Fall-2018 organization. **You do not need to fork anything.** Only you (and we) have access to this repo. You will use the clone/download link from this newly created repo to connect to your computer, as you did for Problem Set #3. You will commit and push as normal.
* There are several other files in this repo: mt_1_assignment.Rmd, mt_1_assignment.html, mt_1_background.html and mt_1_elections-poll-ky06-1.csv. The hmtl is knitted from the Rmd, just as you might expect. 
* Within RStudio, you can read the exam in two ways. One, click on mt_1_assignment.html and select the "View in Web Browser" option. Second, open mt_1_assignment.Rmd in RStudio and then knit it.
* We provide both the Rmd and the html so that you can see how we went from the first to the second.
* The exam provides specific instructions. Follow them closely.
* The exam is open-book and open-web. You may use anything you can find (with one exception, see below). The exam is meant to mimic the real world, to simulate an assignment that you might get from your boss next summer. She won't care if you Google for help. Neither do we. However, you can only ask questions via the course Piazza. (To be specific, you may not ask for help at places like Stack Overflow.)
* You may not post your answers, or any aspect of your work, on the web until one week after the exam is over. Nor may you look at work posted by another student --- this is the exception mentioned above. In other words, if you post your work, or you use the work posted by another student, you will fail.
* In other words, do not ask humans for help, except for the teaching staff via Piazza.
* This exam is, obviously, similar to Problem Set #3. You may use any of your own work from that problem set as well as from our published answers, with no need for attribution. If you use a significant amount of code from the web, please mention that fact (along with a link) in your code comments.

## Data Background
* We will be using polling data from *The New York Times* for Kentuckyâ€™s 6th Congressional District. Background reading [here](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/upshot/elections-poll-ky06-1.html). A permanent copy of this webpage is distributed as a part of this repo: mt_1_background.html.
* Although the data [exists on the web](https://github.com/TheUpshot/2018-live-poll-results), please use the version we have distributed with the exam: mt_1_elections-poll-ky06-1.csv.
